Dear Sir or Madam,


As a professional baker with a passion for bread, I am in the process of writing a book on the science and art of sourdough bread. The manuscript will be finished within a few months, and I intent to publish it within Belgium and the Netherlands, as it is written in Dutch. 

During my research for the book, I came across Job Adriaenszoon Berckheyde's magnificent paintings of bakers and bakeries during the 17th century. One of those particular paintings, '_The Baker_' (1681), is exibited in the Worchester Art Museum. Since this painting displays an assortment of different forms of bread, I was hoping to embed this work into my book, in a chapter about different kinds of bread. 

I hereby request permission to duplicate the work in printed media, in the form of a published book, and would like to be informed on the possible reproduction fees. Since a book about the world of sourdough bread is a niche (waiting to be filled) in our country, I do not expect it to sell more than 10.000 copies, before translating it into English. 

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions or concerns. You can reach me via email at [wouter.groeneveld@gmail.com](mailto:wouter.groeneveld@gmail.com) or:
