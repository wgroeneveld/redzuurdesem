I needed a recipe to try my round cane **banneton** on and this month&#8217;s [Mellow Bakers][1] challenge introduced a nice sourdough recipe: **40% rye sourdough** with **caraway** seeds. According to Mr. Hamelman, the bread &#8220;contains just enough rye to be a serious rye sourdoubh bread&#8221;.<figure id="attachment_378" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

The caraway seeds are something new for me, the recipe calls for 2 tablespoons but as they smelled quite strong, I used teaspoons instead. The end result is a stellar looking and tasting bread with a still very strong caraway flavor. It reminds me of anise seeds. It&#8217;s a bit too much for my liking, I might bake it again next time but without the seeds.
  
You might notice in the pictures below that the bread is still quite grey, for &#8220;only&#8221; 40% wholerye. I liked it, but too bad the sour taste does not get through thanks to the caraway.

I **did not add yeast** in the final dough. I don&#8217;t know why almost all rye sourdough breads call for additional commercial yeast, I find it quite unneeded as the bulk fermentation time could be simply slightly increased (as I did). The crumb is not very dense at all and contains evenly placed little holes. I folded the dough once (or twice? Can&#8217;t remember).<figure style="width: 150px" class="wp-caption alignleft">

  Lessons learned:
</h2>

  * Caraway has a **dominant flavor**, be careful with it, even with teaspoons!
  * **yeast is never needed **with **rye bread**. Especially not with so much gluten present from the &#8220;high gluten&#8221; flour. (I used 13% protein flour).
  * The cane banneton needs to be **floured very well** &#8211; even between the edges. It will eventually release the dough but you have to be careful!
