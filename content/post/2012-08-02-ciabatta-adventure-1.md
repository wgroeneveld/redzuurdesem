# The challenge

The first recipe I&#8217;ve tried in the &#8220;BREAD&#8221; book by Jeffrey Hamelman was baguettes with poolish. It might nog have been a good idea, since the recipe calls for a **very wet dough**. There were some restrictions involved: **no mixer**! This means a lot of stretch & folding and french folding have to be involved.
  
I&#8217;ve been asked to bake a focaccia which uses the ciabatta dough. Last time the wet dough experiments were quite a &#8220;failure&#8221; so I was a little anxious to try this one out. This is the result:<figure id="attachment_365" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Looks rather good, right? But there were some problems involved:

  * The crust was very crisp out of the oven but turned soft after a few hours&#8230; I&#8217;ve learned this is partially unavoidable especially with higher hydratation percentage doughs.
  * The bread was **very chewy** &#8211; a bit too much for my liking. I would have hoped it to be soft!

I more or less followed the recipe by the book except that I also added a 100% hydratation sourdough starter together with a little bit of commercial yeast to create the poolish. That might have been &#8220;too much&#8221;, I&#8217;m not sure. I&#8217;ll have to try the same recipe without that! _Should have stayed with the book_ of course&#8230;

The &#8220;chewy&#8221;-ness is an issue I&#8217;ve been trying to get right for about a month. This is the last batch of &#8220;failed&#8221; baguettes with 75% hydratation:<figure id="attachment_367" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

I used [The Weekend Bakery][3] recipe and cut everything by half &#8211; except the yeast and salt. Whoops, how stupid. It turned out to be quite overproofed &#8211; even for one hour, I can&#8217;t exactly remember the time table on this one. I do remember I threw everything away since it was way too salty!

I **did use the same flour** for everything and I highly suspect this may be the nr. 1 reason why these wet doughs don&#8217;t correctly work out for me. I used white &#8220;all purpose&#8221; flour which can also be used for pastry. It&#8217;s called &#8220;molenaarsbloem&#8221; in Dutch and does not state any protein content. It&#8217;s not bread flour, nor high-gluten or &#8220;strong&#8221; flour.

Another thing I think I might have did wrong was **underkneading** since I did everything by hand and it was extremely difficult. I stretch & folded every 30 minutes for 2,5 hours (might even have to bulk ferment longer next time?!).

This is what I&#8217;ve been trying to replicate:<figure id="attachment_370" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
