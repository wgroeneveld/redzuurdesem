My 70% wholerye attempt did not turn out to be very disappointing for the first try &#8211; read more about it [here][2]. Mr. Hamelman provides a second healthy and earthy rye recipe in his book, but this time with 20% high gluten flour and a soaker of boiling rye flour instead of chopped rye flakes. The previous loaf had to be baked in a tin, this one could be (barely) shaped into a loose _boule_.

#  What you should look for

Since this is a rye bread, kneading, shaping and baking will be quite different from &#8220;traditional&#8221; wheat based breads. Well everything will be quite different in fact. I still need to learn how to control final proofing or fermentation time for rye bread myself, but there are a few tips I can think of &#8211; and posting these here might even help me in the future:

  * Rye sour ideally ferments best at 28-30°C. That&#8217;s higher than I&#8217;m used to for wheat based breads. I usually ferment at &#8220;room temperature&#8221; (between 20 and 23°C). I preheated my microwave for a few seconds and put the container with the dough into the microwave. You&#8217;ll lose heat but it&#8217;s better than nothing.
  
    I _think_, based on this, that it takes less time to proof loaves with rye.
  * Rye absorbs a lot more water than wholewheat flour. That&#8217;s why you need  more water than usual, otherwise you&#8217;ll end up with a brick and start calling the dentist.
  
    If your dough looks like a paste after mixing, that&#8217;s normal. It should be sticky (very).
  * Kneading times are dramatically reduced because there&#8217;s little gluten to be formed for wholerye breads. There are still some gluten present but not much, and even the 20% added high gluten flour would not do much but slightly help the dough lift.

  Recipe and time table
</h1>

Making this bread was not really difficult, the only challenging part it judging whether it&#8217;s ready to be baked or not. I think I underproofed the loaves quite a bit, @ 1 hour. All fermentation temperatures were +/- 30°C.

**the soaker**

  1. 200gr wholerye flour
  2. 200gr boiling water

Prepare the soaker at the same time you&#8217;re making the preferment. Mix and cover as quick as possible to avoid the water from escaping as steam.

**the preferment**

Use **35%** of your final amount rye in the preferment:

  1. 350gr wholerye flour
  2. 290gr water
  3. 20gr mature rye sour (mine was at nearly **100%** hydratation)

If you want, you can let the preferment sit there for up to 24 hours. I&#8217;ve noticed the rye sour can take a lot more than a wheat based _levain_. I&#8217;ve let mine ferment for about 12 hours at room temperature.

**the final dough**

  1. 250gr wholerye flour
  2. 200gr high-gluten wheat flour
  3. 290gr water
  4. 1 tablespoon salt
  5. your soaker & preferment

Bulk ferment: 1 hour, final proofing: 2 hours. (Mine was 1 hour short, turned out to be too flat). You will **not** notice a big oven spring. It should rise a bit though!<figure style="width: 200px" class="wp-caption alignleft">
